<p><i>Dear Dogs</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have brought together in my library a few of the many proofs that show
how true is the affection which many of your masters have for you, and
some-time when I can read them to you privately, you will understand
more fully the place you hold in our lives. I use the word MASTER only
because our language is too poor to express in one word the real
relationship which exists between us, we the master, and you the devoted
slave and trusted servant, the most joyful of playfellows, and the best
of companions, the bravest defender, and the truest friend. I wish I
knew the word in your language which expresses all that you are to us. I
also wish I knew how much you know, and could learn the many things you
would gladly teach us.</p>

<p>You can see what we cannot see.</p>

<p>You can hear sounds we cannot hear.</p>

<p>You interpret signs we cannot read.</p>

<p>You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> scent the trails we cannot find.</p>

<p>You talk to us with your speaking eyes, and we cannot understand.</p>

<p>You are sometimes cruelly treated, and so are human beings, and
sometimes we have to punish you for you are not always good. You have a
certain amount of deviltry in your nature which we rather like, for it
makes you more human and lovable. Your sins, however, are mostly against
the laws we have made for you, not against your own, or those of nature,
which are the laws of a higher power than ours&mdash;the one who made you.</p>

<p>What glorious times have we enjoyed together tramping or riding through
the fields and woods, over the hills and by the streams and through the
swamps, or at the sea, on the sands and rocks, or over the salt marshes,
with gun or camera or botany box, or with nothing at all! We have shared
the best the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> world can give us, nature's gifts. And returning home,
tired and happy, we in the evening, before a bright wood fire, you close
by our side or at our feet only so that you can touch us, have lived
over what the day has given us. Or sometimes at night before a camp fire
with the quiet of the wood sounds all about us, have dreamed of the
ducks and the grouse and the partridges, or of rare flowers or a
beautiful landscape which the past day has brought, or of what the next
day will bring. And perhaps you have dreamed also, a little selfishly
(you are only selfish in your dreams) of the rabbits and squirrels and
the woodchucks which have been the greatest temptation for you to resist
all day long. They must have existed long ago in your garden of Eden.</p>

<p>No matter what our conditions or surroundings in life may be you accept
them gladly. King or peasant, palace or hovel, riches or poverty, plenty
or starvation, burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> sun or ice and snow, if you have once given us
your affection, no matter who or what your master may be, you give him
all you have to give to the very end&mdash;even life itself. It would almost
seem that you were created only to serve us, for wherever man has been,
even in the far past where history is almost a myth, you have been also,
close by his side. Old Egypt, Persia, Greece, and ancient Rome have told
of your fidelity and of your devotion.</p>

<p>You know us in many ways as no human being knows us, for every hour of
your life you wish to be near, and often you are our most intimate
companion and the best friend we have in the world. We talk to you, more
than half believing, or trying to believe, that you understand, and I am
not sure but that to you alone we always tell the absolute truth, we
whisper to you our secrets, we confide to you our hopes and ambitions,
we tell you of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> our successes and our disappointments, and often in deep
grief you alone see what we think is weakness to show to the outside
world. Whatever happens to us we are sure of one friend, even if the
whole world is against us. We trust to you our greatest treasures, our
children, and we know with you they are safe.</p>

<p>When you go to the Happy Hunting Ground you are truly and deeply
mourned, and the great legacy you leave us is the memory of your
loyalty, your devotion, your trust, and memory of the many happy hours
and happy days you have given us in your too short life. And when we are
obliged to say "the King is dead," we do not complete the old saying
"long live the King" for many, many months&mdash;and sometimes never.</p>

Your masters, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>The blank space on the title cover is designed for a photograph, or any

<p>This collection is composed almost entirely of verses that have been
written within the last twenty-five years. I know only too well that I
have omitted many poems that the Dogs should hear, but I have not
attempted a large anthology, for it has been done several times by far
abler hands. I also know you will ask why some of your favorite poems
are not found in this collection, but I have selected only a small
number, among the many that have appealed to me, for I promised to read
only a few to my friends, the Dogs, and I have left many blank half
pages on which you can copy your own favorite Dog Poems.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
<span class="smcap">The</span> Squire sat propped in a pillowed chair,<br />
His eyes were alive and clear of care,<br />
But well he knew that the hour was come<br />
To bid good-bye to his ancient home.<br />
<br />
He looked on garden, wood, and hill,<br />
He looked on the lake, sunny and still;<br />
The last of earth that his eyes could see<br />
Was the island church of Orchardleigh.<br />
<br />
The last that his heart could understand<br />
Was the touch of the tongue that licked his hand:<br />
"Bury the dog at my feet," he said,<br />
And his voice dropped, and the Squire was dead.<br />
<br />
Now the dog was a hound of the Danish breed,<br />
Staunch to love and strong at need:<br />
He had dragged his master safe to shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
When the tide was ebbing at Elsinore.<br />
<br />
From that day forth, as reason would,<br />
He was named "Fidele," and made it good:<br />
When the last of the mourners left the door<br />
Fidele was dead on the chantry floor.<br />
<br />
They buried him there at his master's feet,<br />
And all that heard of it deemed it meet:<br />
The story went the round for years,<br />
Till it came at last to the Bishop's ears.<br />
<br />
Bishop of Bath and Wells was he,<br />
Lord of the lords of Orchardleigh;<br />
And he wrote to the Parson the strongest screed<br />
That Bishop may write or Parson read.<br />
<br />
The sum of it was that a soulless hound<br />
Was known to be buried in hallowed ground:<br />
From scandal sore the Church to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br />
They must take the dog from his master's grave.<br />
<br />
The heir was far in a foreign land,<br />
The Parson was wax to my Lord's command:<br />
He sent for the Sexton and bade him make<br />
A lonely grave by the shore of the lake.<br />
<br />
The Sexton sat by the water's brink<br />
Where he used to sit when he used to think:<br />
He reasoned slow, but he reasoned it out,<br />
And his argument left him free from doubt.<br />
<br />
"A Bishop," he said, "is the top of his trade:<br />
But there's others can give him a start with the spade:<br />
Yon dog, he carried the Squire ashore,<br />
And a Christian couldn't ha' done no more."<br />
<br />
The grave was dug; the mason came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><br />
And carved on stone Fidele's name:<br />
But the dog that the Sexton laid inside<br />
Was a dog that never had lived or died.<br />
<br />
So the Parson was praised, and the scandal stayed,<br />
Till, a long time after, the church decayed,<br />
And, laying the floor anew, they found<br />
In the tomb of the Squire the bones of a hound.<br />
<br />
As for the Bishop of Bath and Wells,<br />
No more of him the story tells;<br />
Doubtless he lived as a Prelate and Prince,<br />
And died and was buried a century since.<br />
<br />
And whether his view was right or wrong<br />
Has little to do with this my song;<br />
Something we owe him, you must allow;<br />
And perhaps he has changed his mind by now.<br />
<br />
The Squire in the family chantry sleeps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><br />
The marble still his memory keeps:<br />
Remember, when the name you spell,<br />
There rest Fidele's bones as well.<br />
<br />
For the Sexton's grave you need not search,<br />
'Tis a nameless mound by the island church:<br />
An ignorant fellow, of humble lot&mdash;<br />
But he knew one thing that a Bishop did not.</td></tr></table>

Leo the shaggy, the lustrous, the giant, the gentle Newfoundland.<br />
Dark are his eyes as the night, and black is his hair as the midnight;<br />
Large and slow is his tread till he sees his master returning,<br />
Then how he leaps in the air, with motion ponderous, frightening!<br />
Now, as I pass to my work, I hear o'er the roar of the city&mdash;<br />
Far over the roofs of the houses, I hear the barking of Leo;<br />
For me he is moaning and crying, for me in measure sonorous<br />
He raises his marvelous voice, for me he is wailing and calling.<br />
None can assuage his grief, tho' but for a day is the parting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br />
Tho' morn after morn 'tis the same, tho' home every night comes his master,<br />
Still will he grieve when we sever, and wild will be his rejoicing<br />
When at night his master returns and lays but a hand on his forehead.<br />
No lack will there be in the world of faith, of love, and devotion,<br />
No lack for me and for mine, while Leo alone is living&mdash;<br />
While over the roofs of the houses I hear the barking of Leo.</td></tr></table>

The ground, which hides thee now, but four?<br />
And all that life, and all that love,<br />
Were crowded, Geist! into no more?<br />
<br />
Only four years those winning ways,<br />
Which make me for thy presence yearn,<br />
Call'd us to pet thee or to praise,<br />
Dear little friend! at every turn?<br />
<br />
That loving heart, that patient soul,<br />
Had they indeed no longer span,<br />
To run their course, and reach their goal,<br />
And read their homily to man?<br />
<br />
That liquid, melancholy eye,<br />

The sense of tears in mortal things&mdash;<br />
<br />
That steadfast, mournful strain, consoled<br />
By spirits gloriously gay,<br />
And temper of heroic mould&mdash;<br />
What, was four years their whole short day?<br />
<br />
Yes, only four!&mdash;and not the course<br />
Of all the centuries yet to come,<br />
And not the infinite resource<br />
Of Nature, with her countless sum<br />
<br />
Of figures, with her fulness vast<br />
Of new creation evermore,<br />
Can ever quite repeat the past,<br />
Or just thy little self restore.<br />
<br />
Stern law of every mortal lot!<br />
Which man, proud man, finds hard to bear,<br />
And builds himself I know not what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><br />
Of second life I know not where.<br />
<br />
But thou, when struck thine hour to go,<br />
On us, who stood despondent by,<br />
A meek last glance of love didst throw,<br />
And humbly lay thee down to die.<br />
<br />
Yet would we keep thee in our heart&mdash;<br />
Would fix our favourite on the scene,<br />
Nor let thee utterly depart<br />
And be as if thou ne'er hadst been.<br />
<br />
And so there rise these lines of verse<br />
On lips that rarely form them now;<br />
While to each other we rehearse:<br />
<i>Such ways, such arts, such looks hadst thou!</i><br />
<br />
We stroke thy broad brown paws again,<br />
We bid thee to thy vacant chair,<br />
We greet thee by the window-pane,<br />
We hear thy scuffle on the stair.<br />
<br />
We see the flaps of thy large ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br />
Quick raised to ask which way we go;<br />
Crossing the frozen lake, appears<br />
Thy small black figure on the snow!<br />
<br />
Nor to us only art thou dear<br />
Who mourn thee in thine English home;<br />
Thou hast thine absent master's tear,<br />
Dropt by the far Australian foam.<br />
<br />
Thy memory lasts both here and there,<br />
And thou shalt live as long as we.<br />
And after that&mdash;thou dost not care!<br />
In us was all the world to thee.<br />
<br />
Yet, fondly zealous for thy fame,<br />
Even to a date beyond our own<br />
We strive to carry down thy name,<br />
By mounded turf, and graven stone.<br />
<br />
We lay thee, close within our reach,<br />
Here, where the grass is smooth and warm,<br />
Between the holly and the beech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br />
Where oft we watch'd thy couchant form,<br />
<br />
Asleep, yet lending half an ear<br />
To travellers on the Portsmouth road;&mdash;<br />
There build we thee, O guardian dear,<br />
Mark'd with a stone, thy last abode!<br />
<br />
Then some, who through this garden pass,<br />
When we too, like thyself, are clay,<br />
Shall see thy grave upon the grass,<br />
And stop before the stone, and say:<br />
<br />
<i>People who lived here long ago<br />
Did by this stone, it seems, intend<br />
To name for future times to know<br />
The dachs-hound, Geist, their little friend.</i></td></tr></table>

From men and women to fill our day;<br />
But when we are certain of sorrow in store,<br />
Why do we always arrange for more?<br />
<i>Brothers and sisters, I bid you beware<br />

Love unflinching that cannot lie&mdash;<br />
Perfect passion and worship fed<br />

To risk your heart for a dog to tear.</i><br />
<br />
When the fourteen years which Nature permits<br />
Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,<br />
And the vet's unspoken prescription runs<br />
To lethal chambers or loaded guns,<br />
<i>Then you will find&mdash;it's your own affair</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><br />
<i>But ... you 've given your heart to a dog to tear.</i><br />
<br />
When the body that lived at your single will<br />
When the whimper of welcome is stilled (how still!)<br />
When the spirit that answered your every mood<br />
Is gone&mdash;wherever it goes&mdash;for good,<br />
<i>You will discover how much you care,<br />
And will give your heart to a dog to tear!</i><br />
<br />
We've sorrow enough in the natural way,<br />
When it comes to burying Christian clay.<br />
Our loves are not given, but only lent,<br />
At compound interest of cent per cent.<br />
Though it is not always the case, I believe,<br />
That the longer we've kept 'em, the more do we grieve:<br />
For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><br />

Bones, broth and biscuits, is prepared for you.<br />
See how it steams in your enamelled dish,<br />
Mixed in each part according to your wish.<br />
Hide in your straw the bones you cannot crunch&mdash;<br />
They'll come in handy for to-morrow's lunch;<br />
Abstract with care each tasty scrap of meat,<br />
Remove each biscuit to a fresh retreat<br />
(A dog, I judge, would deem himself disgraced<br />
Who ate a biscuit where he found it placed);<br />
Then nuzzle round and make your final sweep,<br />
And sleep, replete, your after-dinner sleep.<br />
High in our hall we've piled the fire with logs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><br />
For you, the <i>doyen</i> of our corps of dogs.<br />
There, when the stroll that health demands is done,<br />
Your right to ease by due exertion won,<br />
There shall you come, and on your long-haired mat,<br />
Thrice turning round, shall tread the jungle flat,<br />
And, rhythmically snoring, dream away<br />
The peaceful evening of your New Year's day.<br />
<br />
Rufus! there are who hesitate to own<br />
Merits, they say, your master sees alone.<br />
They judge you stupid, for you show no bent<br />
To any poodle-dog accomplishment.<br />
Your stubborn nature never stooped to learn<br />
Tricks by which mumming dogs their biscuits earn.<br />
Men mostly find you, if they change their seat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br />
Couchant obnoxious to their blundering feet;<br />
Then, when a door is closed, you steadily<br />
Misjudge the side on which you ought to be;<br />
Yelping outside when all your friends are in,<br />
You raise the echoes with your ceaseless din,<br />
Or, always wrong, but turn and turn about,<br />
Howling inside when all the world is out.<br />
They scorn your gestures and interpret ill<br />
Your humble signs of friendship and goodwill;<br />
Laugh at your gambols, and pursue with jeers<br />
The ringlets clustered on your spreading ears;<br />
See without sympathy your sore distress<br />
When Ray obtains the coveted caress,<br />
And you, a jealous lump of growl and glare,<br />
Hide from the world your head beneath a chair.<br />
They say your legs are bandy&mdash;so they are:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><br />
Nature so formed them that they might go far;<br />
They cannot brook your music; they assail<br />
The joyful quiverings of your stumpy tail&mdash;<br />
In short, in one anathema confound<br />
Shape, mind and heart, and all, my little hound.<br />
Well, let them rail. If, since your life began,<br />
Beyond the customary lot of man<br />
Staunchness was yours; if of your faithful heart<br />
Malice and scorn could never claim a part;<br />
If in your master, loving while you live,<br />
You own no fault or own it to forgive;<br />
If, as you lay your head upon his knee,<br />
Your deep-drawn sighs proclaim your sympathy;<br />
If faith and friendship, growing with your age,<br />
Speak through your eyes and all his love engage;<br />
If by that master's wish your life you rule&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br />
If this be folly, Rufus, you're a fool.<br />
<br />
Old dog, content you; Rufus, have no fear:<br />
While life is yours and mine your place is here.<br />
And when the day shall come, as come it must,<br />
When Rufus goes to mingle with the dust<br />
(If Fate ordains that you shall pass before<br />
To the abhorred and sunless Stygian shore),<br />
I think old Charon, punting through the dark,<br />
Will hear a sudden friendly little bark;<br />
And on the shore he'll mark without a frown<br />
A flap-eared doggie, bandy-legged and brown.<br />
He'll take you in: since watermen are kind,<br />
He'd scorn to leave my little dog behind.<br />
He'll ask no obol, but instal you there<br />
On Styx's further bank without a fare.<br />
There shall you sniff his cargoes as they come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><br />
And droop your head, and turn, and still be dumb&mdash;<br />
Till one fine day, half joyful, half in fear,<br />
You run and prick a recognising ear,<br />
And last, oh, rapture! leaping to his hand,<br />
Salute your master as he steps to land.</td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Roger, my dear old doggie, they say that your race is run;<br />
And our jolly tramps together up and down the world are done;<br />
You're only a dog, old fellow, a dog, and you've had your day;<br />
But never a friend of all my friends has been truer than you alway.<br />
<br />
We've had glorious times together in the fields and pastures fair;<br />
In storm and sunny weather we have romped without a care;<br />
And however men have treated me, though foul or fair their deal&mdash;<br />
However many the friends that failed, I've found you true as steel.<br />
<br />
That's right, my dear old fellow, look up with your knowing eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><br />
And lick my hand with your loving tongue that never has told a lie;<br />
And don't be afraid, old doggie, if your time has come to go,<br />
For somewhere out in the great Unknown there's a place for you, I know.<br />
<br />
Then don't you worry, old Comrade; and don't you fear to die;<br />
For out in that fairer country I will find you by and by;<br />
And I'll stand by you, old fellow, and our love will surely win,<br />
For never a heaven shall harbor me where they won't let Roger in.<br />
<br />
When I reach that city glorious, behind the waiting dark,<br />
Just come and stand outside the gate, and wag your tail and bark&mdash;<br/>
I'll hear your voice, and I'll know it, and I'll come to the gate and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span><br />
"Saint Peter, that's my dog out there, you must let him come this way."<br />
<br />
And then if the saint refuses, I'll go to the One above,<br />
And say: "Old Roger is at the gate, with his heart brim full of love;<br />
And there isn't a shining angel, of all the heavenly band,<br />
Who ever lived a nobler life than he in the earthly land."<br />
<br />
Then I know the gate will open, and you will come frisking in,<br />
And we'll roam fair fields together, in that country free from sin.<br />
So never you mind, old Roger, if your time has come to go;<br />
You've been true to me, I'll be true to you&mdash;and the Lord is good, we know.<br />
<br />
You're only a dog, old fellow; a dog, and you've had your day&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><br />
Well, I'm getting there myself, old boy, and I haven't long to stay;<br />
But you've stood by me, old Comrade, and I'm bound to stand by you;<br />
So don't you worry, old Roger, for our love will pull us through.</td></tr></table>

<span class="smcap">Sir Bat-ears</span> was a dog of birth<br />
And bred in Aberdeen,<br />
But he favoured not his noble kin<br />
And so his lot is mean,<br />
And Sir Bat-ears sits by the almshouses<br />
On the stones with grass between.<br />
<br />
Under the ancient archway<br />
His pleasure is to wait<br />
Between the two stone pineapples<br />
That flank the weathered gate;<br />
<br />
And old, old alms-persons go by,<br />
All rusty, bent and black,<br />
"Good-day, good-day, Sir Bat-ears,"<br />
They say and stroke his back.<br />
<br />
And old, old alms-persons go by,<br />
Shaking and well-nigh dead,<br />
"Good-night, good-night, Sir Bat-ears!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><br />
They say and pat his head.<br />
<br />
So courted and considered<br />
He sits out hour by hour,<br />
Benignant in the sunshine<br />
And prudent in the shower.<br />
<br />
(Nay, stoutly can he stand a storm<br />
And stiffly breast the rain,<br />
That rising when the cloud is gone<br />
He leaves a circle of dry stone<br />
Whereon to sit again.)<br />
<br />
A dozen little door steps<br />
Under the arch are seen,<br />
A dozen aged alms-persons<br />
To keep them bright and clean:<br />
<br />
Two wrinkled hands to scour each step<br />
With a square of yellow stone&mdash;<br />
But print-marks of Sir Bat-ears' paws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><br />
Bespeckle every one.<br />
<br />
And little eats an alms-person,<br />
But, though his board be bare,<br />
There never lacks a bone of the best<br />
To be Sir Bat-ears' share.<br />
<br />
Mendicant muzzle and shrewd nose,<br />
He quests from door to door;<br />
Their grace they say&mdash;his shadow gray<br />
Is instant on the floor,<br />
Humblest of all the dogs there be,<br />
A pensioner of the poor.</td></tr></table>

With a new look of wonder in it, asking why<br />
"The whole creation groans and travails." He<br />

Finding me dumb and helpless, down again<br />
He went, unanswered, with the dawn to die,<br />

For truest, gentlest heart, among<br />

Sat musing by the warm firelight&mdash;<br />

Of fleeting years could ne'er estrange.<br />
For he who once has gained the love<br />
And friendship of a dog shall prove<br />
Thro' joy and sorrow to the end<br />
The deep devotion of a friend.<br />
What is it? More than instinct fine,<br />
This something man cannot divine,<br />
Which speaks from eyes where lips are mute,<br />
Which makes the creature we name brute<br />
The noblest pattern we may see<br />
Of loving, lasting loyalty.<br />
We dare not call it mind or soul,<br />
We know not what or where its goal,<br />
But aye we know its little span<br />
Of life spells large&mdash;Friendship to man;<br />
Nor wonder Scott, in grief, should say,<br />
"I lost a much-loved friend to-day!"</td></tr></table>

Oh, Adult Dog, the time is up<br />
When I may fondly call you Pup.<br />
The years have sped since first you stood<br />
In straddle-legged puppyhood,&mdash;<br />
A watch-pup, proud of your renown,<br />
Who barked so hard you tumbled down.<br />
In Age's gain and Youth's retreat<br />
You've found more team-work for your feet,<br />
You drool a soupçon less, and hark!<br />
There's fuller meaning to your bark.<br />
But answer fairly, whilom pup,<br />
Are these full proof of growing up?<br />
<br />
I heard an elephantine tread<br />
That jarred the rafters overhead:<br />
<i>Who</i> leaped in mad abandon there<br />
And tossed my slippers in the air?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><br />
<i>Who</i>, sitting gravely on the rug,<br />
Espied a microscopic bug<br />
And stalked it, gaining bit by bit,&mdash;<br />
Then leapt in air and fell on it?<br />
<i>Who</i> gallops madly down the breeze<br />
Pursuing specks that no one sees,<br />
Then finds some ancient boot instead<br />
And worries it till it is dead?<br />
<i>I</i> have no adult friends who choose<br />
To gnaw the shoe-strings from my shoes,&mdash;<br />
Who eat up twine and paper scraps<br />
And bark while they are taking naps.<br />
Oh Dog, you offer every proof<br />
That stately age yet holds aloof.<br />
Grown up? There's meaning in the phrase<br />
Of dignity as well as days.<br />
Oh why such size, beloved pup?&mdash;<br />
You've grown enough, but not grown up.</td></tr></table>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
